# Green-vs-Red
'Green vs. Red' is a game played on a 2D grid. Each cell on this grid can be either green (represented by 1) or red (represented by 0). The game always receives an initial state of the grid which we will call 'Generation Zero'. After that a set of 4 rules are applied across the grid and those rules form the next generation.
